# Soil Health Exchange

This repository contains a single-page React application for exploring soil health questions and answers.

## Running Locally

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser **or** serve the directory with a static file server.
   For example, using `npx serve`:

   ```bash
   npx serve .
   ```

2. Navigate to the provided local address to view the site.

The application relies on CDN-hosted dependencies, so no build step is required.
